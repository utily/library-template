# library-template
Template for Typescript library.

## Configuration files
### `package.json`
Important fields in this file

#### `"type"`
Should be set to `"module"`. Modules are the future.

#### `"exports"`
Exports define which file should be imported when the module is imported. each import path can be split up into an `import` field and a `require` field. `import` points to the ESM entry and `require` points to the CJS entry.

#### `"main"`
Included for legacy reasons. Export field has priority for consumers supporting it. This points to the main entry for users importing via `require`

#### `"module"`
A widespread unofficial field included for legacy and bundler reasons. Many bundlers might still look for this field. This points to the main entry for users importing via `import`

#### `"types"`
Included for legacy reasons. Types defined by exports field should have priority but there types will be used by consumers using the `main` and `module` fields.
